00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
See the options with -h.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,100
For instance, -F open a file directly.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
Use arrow keys to move between files:

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,200
Right open the next file in the folder,

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Left the previous.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
ARTview use Py-ART to open files.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,700
It opens PPI files,

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,000
RHI files,

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,100
and Airborne files.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
You may also open with Py-ART,

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:18,200
and use ARTview in the Python terminal.

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:27,200
Use 'artview.view.view' for that.

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,300

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,300
Down for previous sweep,

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,300
Up for the next.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,400
or open radio menus.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,600
and the colormap

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700

Save the plot to a image file.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Artview is really versatil,

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
you may open multiple displays
to compare your data

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You may also link displays:

33
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,300
the fields are unlinked:
 the displays show diferent fields

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
the fields are linked:
the displays share the same field,

35
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:58,400
changing one, changes the other.

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,500
ARTview has plug-ins for some
 of the Py-ART functions

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,500
For instance, Mapper uses 'pyart.map.grid_from_radars'

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,600
ARTview also work with grided data,

39
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,700
and uses 'pyart.io.write_grid' to save 
the grid to a file

40
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
ARTview has also original features,

41
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,800
like selecting a subset of the data.

42
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,800
View the data in a table,

43
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,900
save in a file,

44
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,900
and get statatic informations.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You may also write your own
program in ARTview.

46
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100
For instance: just one display, no menu.
